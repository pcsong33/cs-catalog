Nearly two decades ago those platforms were conceptually simple: a \\n\"generative\" base offered by one manufacturer, on which any third party could build. (Think: \\nWindows and the programs that run on it.) Some efforts by platform makers to tip the scales in \\ntheir favor in the layer above resulted in extended controversy and regulatory efforts, such as \\nover Windows coming bundled with Internet Explorer. Today platforms are just as vital but far \\nmore complex. We have hybrids like the iOS and Android operating systems or the Facebook \\nand Twitter platforms, where the platform makers offer their systems as services rather than \\nproducts, influencing and sometimes outright limiting connection between users and independent \\ndevelopers for those platforms. How should we think about these new platforms? What counts as \\na \"level playing field,\" and what responsibility, if any, is there for public authorities to enforce it? \\nWhat lessons, if any, do the prior tangles offer for today? \\nNote: This course is jointly-offered with the Kennedy School as DPI-668 and with the Law \\nSchool as 2601. \\n\\nComputer Science 20.

Th., 5–7 p.m. \\nThe Internet operates in layers, and so does much of the technology that hooks up to it: PCs, \\nmobile phones, tablets. Nearly two decades ago those platforms were conceptually simple: a \\n\"generative\" base offered by one manufacturer, on which any third party could build. (Think: \\nWindows and the programs that run on it.) Some efforts by platform makers to tip the scales in \\ntheir favor in the layer above resulted in extended controversy and regulatory efforts, such as \\nover Windows coming bundled with Internet Explorer. Today platforms are just as vital but far \\nmore complex. We have hybrids like the iOS and Android operating systems or the Facebook \\nand Twitter platforms, where the platform makers offer their systems as services rather than \\nproducts, influencing and sometimes outright limiting connection between users and independent \\ndevelopers for those platforms. How should we think about these new platforms? What counts as \\na \"level playing field,\" and what responsibility, if any, is there for public authorities to enforce it? \\nWhat lessons, if any, do the prior tangles offer for today? \\nNote: This course is jointly-offered with the Kennedy School as DPI-668 and with the Law \\nSchool as 2601. \\n\\nComputer Science 20.

Big Data Systems \\nCata',\n  ' 2083  \\nStratos Idreos  \\nHalf course (fall term). W., F., 1–2:30. EXAM GROUP: 1 \\nBig data is everywhere. A fundamental goal across numerous modern businesses and sciences is \\nto be able to exploit as many machines as possible, to consume as much information as possible \\nand as fast as possible. The big challenge is \"how to turn data into useful knowledge\". This is far \\nfrom a simple task and a moving target as both the underlying hardware and our ability to collect \\ndata evolve. In this class, we will discuss how to design data systems and algorithms that can \\n\"scale up\" and \"scale out\". Scale up refers to the ability to use a single machine to all its \\npotential, i.e., to exploit properly the memory hierarchy and the multiple CPU and GPU cores. \\nScale out refers to the ability to use more than 1 machines (typically 100s or 1000s) effectively. \\nThis is a research oriented class. Every week we will read two modern research papers; one from \\nthe scale up area and one from the scale out area. We will use examples from several areas, \\nincluding relational systems and distributed databases, graph processing systems (i.e., for social \\nnetworks), key value stores, noSQL and newSQL systems as well as mobile computing. Each \\nstudent will work on a semester long data systems research project (in groups of 2-4 students) \\nwhich can be in any of the above areas and will be based on an open research problem. \\nPrerequisite: CS 165 or permission of instructor. \\n\\nComputer Science 277.
